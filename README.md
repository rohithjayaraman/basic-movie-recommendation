# basic-movie-recommendation
A very basic movie recommendation algorithm

## Copyright notice
The data used in this project was taken from Kaggle and Grouplens (sources for which are mentioned at the end of this file). This project is a purely educational one built for improving understanding and as a hobby. The intellectual property used in this project is purely for educational purposes only. This project and any of the data in it should not be used for commerical purposes.

## Aim
This program is meant to give a basic practical implementation and understanding of recommender systems and the 2 main approaches namely Content based and Collaborative Filtering based recommendation.

## Running the program
This application is basically a python notebook that was made and used as a Kaggle notebook. The dataset used (movielens 100K) is directly available through kaggle and so this notebook uses that as a source. 

To run this simply, upload it onto a kaggle notebook, add the required dataset and run it.

## References
I read a few blogs in order to understand the implementation better. I have listed them and would like to thank the authors.
